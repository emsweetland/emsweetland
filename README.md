### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**emsweetland/emsweetland** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:


-I'm currently studying fullstack software development with the Mitchison cohort of Prime Digital Academy!
-Prime Academy teaches technical skills, along with soft skills, over a 20 week course. Our class graduates October 21st.
-I just wrapped up my solo project; A two week sprint, delivering a full CRUD, MVP version of my app, Moody.
-Check out my deployment on heroku: https://dry-bayou-45188.herokuapp.com/#/home
-I'm looking forward to my next two week sprint!
-After meeting with a client, I will work with a group to deliver a full stack app built to their specifications.

-Before coding, my background involved art, landscaping and customer service. Through these avenues, I've learned a lot about empathy, and how it really fuels connection. I like to consider people before getting to the product.

-I'm looking forward to collaborating with many people in the future!
