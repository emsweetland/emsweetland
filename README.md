### Hello World!

âœ¨ As of October 21st, 2022, I have graduated with the Mitchison cohort of Prime Digital Academy!
âœ¨ Prime Academy teaches fundamental coding skills over a 20 week course. In these short 20 weeks I've been able to implement the following technologies:
ðŸŽ‰ HTML, CSS, Material UI, JavaScript, React, Redux, Sagas, Node, PostgresSQL, C#, .NET

âœ¨ Before coding, my background involved art, landscaping and customer service. Through these avenues, I've learned a lot about empathy, and how it really fuels connection. I make an effort consider people before getting to the product.

âœ¨ Check out my solo project! A two week sprint, delivering a full CRUD, MVP version of my app, Moody.

âœ¨ I've just wrapped up my first real-world client project! OQX is an interactive timeline delivering Queer History for an audience as young as 10 years old. I've had the pleasure of working on a team of 5 developers to deliver this full stack app built to our client's needs.
ðŸ—£ Team includes Tim Anderson (TimothyMichael85), Kas Eam (KassandraEam), Taylor Moe (taylormoe93), and Eric Prouty (Proutyeahs)

âœ¨ I'm looking forward to collaborating on teams that bring joy and/or improve quality of life to their users through their work.
