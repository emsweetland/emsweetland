### Hello World!

✨ As of October 21st, 2022, I have graduated with the Mitchison cohort of Prime Digital Academy!

✨ Before coding, my background involved art, landscaping and customer service. Through these avenues, I've learned a lot about empathy, and how it really fuels connection. I make an effort consider people before getting to the product.

✨ I'm am driven by collaborating on teams that bring joy and/or improve quality of life to their users through their work.
