### Hello World!

âœ¨ As of October 21st, 2022, I have graduated with the Mitchison cohort of Prime Digital Academy!

âœ¨ Prime Academy teaches fundamental coding skills over a 20 week course. In these short 20 weeks I've been able to implement the following technologies:

ðŸŽ‰ HTML, CSS, Material UI, JavaScript, React, Redux, Sagas, Node, PostgresSQL, C#, .NET

âœ¨ Before coding, my background involved art, landscaping and customer service. Through these avenues, I've learned a lot about empathy, and how it really fuels connection. I make an effort consider people before getting to the product.

ðŸ“Œ Check out my solo project! A two week sprint, delivering a full CRUD, MVP version of my app, Moody.

âœ¨ My first real-world client project, OQX, is an interactive timeline delivering Queer History for an audience as young as 10 years old. I've had the pleasure of working on a team of 5 developers to deliver this full stack app built to our client's needs within a two week sprint.

ðŸ—£ Team includes <a href=https://github.com/TimothyMichael85>Tim Anderson</a>, <a href=https://github.com/Kassandraeam>Kas Eam</a>, <a href=https://github.com/taylormoe93>Taylor Moe</a>, and <a href=https://github.com/Proutyeahs>Eric Prouty</a>

âœ¨ I'm am driven by collaborating on teams that bring joy and/or improve quality of life to their users through their work.
